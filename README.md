### Problem
In this problem, weâ€™re interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. 

## Methods
#### Breadth First Search
Implemented in degrees.py by using a Queue data structure. Best approach when looking for the shortest path.

#### Depth First Search
Implemented in degrees.py by using a Stack data structure. This approach finds the target however it does not always find the shortest path.
